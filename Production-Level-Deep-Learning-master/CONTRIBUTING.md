# Contributing to this guideline

- This guideline reflects what I learned from the state of the art conferences and workshops in AI, not my experience as an open source maintainer. 

- If you think something important is missing or should be different based on your experience, I'd love to hear it! If you have suggestions for improving this guideline, please submit a **pull request**.

- Please be mindful that the goal is to collect a selection of the **best** (and not all) practices for different components of an end-to-end pipeline.
